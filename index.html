  <h1>Hello.</h1>

  <p>I'm Saturn. I'm a student currently studying computer science and creative writing. I'm not very good with either, but hopefully what this page displays will continue to evolve.</p>

  <h1>Goals for 2020<h1>

  <p> Firstly, I'd like to move to Seattle. I miss my home. Once I move there, I really do hope I'll be able to get rid of my car and just bike where I need to go. While partly inspired by my suspended license, I'd like to live a healthier and more sustainable (and cheaper!) lifestyle. In the meantime, until such things can occur, I'd like to give this whole webdev and programming thing an honest go. No half-hearted, one lesson a day for a few weeks until I quit attempts. Just one, ongoing, giving it my all shot. It'd be quite nice to actually finish my AdWords certificatation as well. It'd be beneficial in the short term until I can solidify my position in the dev world. While it may be unrealistic to think I may accomplish all of this, I want to try regardless.</p>
